seasonLinks = getSeasonLinks(2022, 10)
teamData = getAllTeams()
pacTeams = getConferenceTeams(teamData, "PAC")
pac.teams.df = data.frame(pacTeams)
playByPlayLinks = c()
for (wk in seasonLinks) {
  wkLinks = getWeekPlayByPlayLinks(wk)
  playByPlayLinks = append(playByPlayLinks, wkLinks)
}
```


Get team Play by Play for 2022 season weeks 1-10
```{r}
bigBadTable = NULL
team.df = data.frame(getPlayByPlayTable(playByPlayLinks, bigBadTable, wantedTeams = pacTeams))
```

```{r}
df = rbind(df, team.df)
# remove duplicate rows
df.unq = df %>% distinct()
